abstract: "Abrupt transitions in ecosystems can be interconnected, raising challenges for science and management in identifying sufficient interventions to prevent them or recover from undesirable shifts. Here we use principles of network controllability to explore how difficult it is to manage coupled regime shifts. We find that coupled regime shifts are easier to manage when they share drivers, but can become harder to manage if new feedbacks are formed when coupled. Simulation experiments showed that both network structure and coupling strength matter in our ability to manage interconnected systems. This theoretical observation calls for an empirical assessment of cascading regime shifts in ecosystems and warns about our limited ability to control cascading effects."

# Introduction

Regime shifts are large, abrupt and persistent changes in the function
and structure of systems [@Anonymous:2004bq; @Scheffer:2001p2968]. They
have been documented in a variety of social-ecological systems
[@Scheffer:2009wl; @Biggs:2018hx], as well as climate [@Lenton:2019fv],
finance[@Guttal:2016kl], or health [@vandeLeemput:2014eb], to name a few
examples. Changes in structure and function of ecosystems can diminish
the benefits people get from nature such as food production, employment
opportunities, climate regulation, or water purification
[@Carpenter:2009jr]. For example, the North Atlantic cod collapse
represented millions of economic loss and compromised more than 35000
jobs in 400 coastal communities[@gien2000land]. The weakening or late
arrival of the Indian summer monsoon can compromise food production in
one of the most densely populated regions of the world. How management
strategies avoid regime shifts or recover natural ecosystems to
desirable regimes are key research questions and an active area of
research.

But one theoretical fact that complicates their study and management is
that regime shifts can be interconnected [@Rocha:2018gn]. The occurrence
of one can impact the likelihood of another through sequential tipping,
like a domino effect [@Wunderling:fj; @Rocha:2018gn]; or through two-way
interactions where new feedbacks can amplify or dampen the probability
of tipping over [@Rocha:2018gn]. Conceptual work have looked at these
connections in the context of committed risk [@Steffen:2018ku;
@Lenton:2019fv], and recent modeling work has studied at interactions
between climate tipping elements to understand additional challenges of
prediction [@Dekker:2010p5900], or the role of minimal network
configurations [@Wunderling:2020jk]. Besides climate, cascading effects
have also been studied in the context of engineered systems
[@Brummitt:2012it; @DSouza:2017hz], social and economic systems
[@Lee:2011p6824, @Brummitt:2017cg; @Anonymous:2015jy], or diseases
[@Watts:2005bq].

The possibility of cascading regime shifts raises a few additional
challenges for management. First, long distance coupling or
teleconnections [@Liu:2015go] between regime shifts implies that optimal
local or regional managerial practices might not be enough to reach
managerial objectives [@Rocha:2018gn; @Anonymous:2015du]. This not only
illustrates the governance issue of with whom to coordinate for
successful management of local resources; it also implies a tragedy of
the commons with potential power asymmetries. Classical examples include
transnational resource systems where pollution or exploitation of a
resource on one side of the border impacts its quality on the other
side, or downstream [@young2002institutional; @keys2018megacity].
Second, and most importantly, connected regime shifts pose the challenge
of identifying sufficient and appropriate points of intervention for
managerial actions. In an interconnected world, how can we identify
leverage points to manage regime shifts? Are there regime shifts -- or
their interactions - that are harder to manage?

\label{fig:ind}
\end{figure*}

Here we answer these questions in the light of controllability of
complex systems. A system is controllable if one can drive it from any
initial state to any desired final state in finite time [@Kalman:1963bt;
@Liu:2015wl; @Liu:2011p6911]. Hence, controllability quantifies our
ability to steer dynamical systems [@Liu:2011p6911]. While control
theory has been fairly well developed in the realm of linear systems,
many open problems remain for nonlinear ones [@Cowan:2012fk;
@Liu:2015wl]. Strict global controllability of nonlinear systems remain
elusive, but weaker notions of controllability can be described
[@Liu:2015wl; @Zanudo:2017hw; @Mochizuki:2013uz]. For example, open loop
control has been used to steer chaotic systems to desired trajectories
in the phase space. Here we focus on feedback vertex sets as a proxy of
structural controllability [@Liu:2015wl; @Zanudo:2017hw] of regime
shifts and their interactions. We use network topology to gain insights
on the controllability of regime shift and the management challenges of
their cascading effects. We further test our intuitions with minimal
models of interconnected resources and pollution recipient systems.

# Methods

We study structural controllability first in a static setting, and then
using minimal simulation experiments to approximate the dynamics of
interconnected systems. For the static setting we used causal diagrams
derived from the regime shifts database, an open online repository of
regime shift reviews [@Biggs:2018hx]. The database offers causal graphs
that summarize scientific hypotheses of how regime shifts work. Each
directed graph (N=30) can be interpreted as a network where a link
between two variables exists if a scientific paper has suggested a
causal link to the occurrence of the regime shift [@Biggs:2018hx]. We
use these networks to study structural controllability (Fig
\ref{fig:sm_clds}).

**Feedback control:** To steer a nonlinear system to a desired
attractor, one needs to find the feedback vertex set of the system. When
the system is described as a network, its state variables are
represented by nodes (or vertices), and the dependence between variables
as directed links (or arcs). A feedback in this context is a collection
of nodes and links that form a circular pathway. Feedbacks are often
responsible for the nonlinear dynamics of the system. If a network has
feedbacks, it is called a directed cyclic graph (DCG), and if it lacks
them a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The feedback vertex set is the set
of nodes that if deleted would render a DAG. The feedback arc set is the
set of links that if eliminated would render a DAG. Finding the feedback
vertex set or the arc set are equivalent problems [@Zhou:2016hu], yet
finding the minimum set is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard
(NP-hard) problem. Once the system is reduced to a DAG, linear control
methods can be applied, such as finding unmatched nodes or the Kalman
rank condition for linear systems [@Liu:2015wl; @Liu:2011p6911]. Hence,
the set of nodes that need to be controlled to gain leverage on the
behaviour of a nonlinear system are the feedback vertex set plus the
unmatched nodes of the remaining linear system [@Zanudo:2017hw;
@Liu:2015wl].

**Structural control on causal networks** We compute the proportion of
nodes that needs to be controlled for all causal networks from the
regime shifts database (Fig \ref{fig:sm_clds}), as well as their
pair-wise combinations. The pair-wise combinations have been used to
study plausible mechanisms that can couple different types of regime
shifts known as cascading effects [@Rocha:2018gn]. We then compare how
structural controllability changes if ecological regime shifts are
interconnected.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 6.5in, height = 2.5in]{fig2_combined-control}
\caption{\textbf{Structural controllability of coupled regime shifts} The proportion of nodes that need to be controlled to manage individual regime shifts (A) compared against the number of nodes (B) and ratio of nodes (C) that one needs to control to manage coupled regime shifts. Top controlling nodes are ranked by the number of pair-wise compbinations where they appear on the control set (D). For a sample of 30 regime shifts, there are 900 pair-wise combinations or 870 combinations of non-identical regime shifts. Thus, for example, fertilizers use and sewage appear in more than 175 of these combinations.}
\label{fig:coup}
\end{figure*}

**Dynamic control on minimal models** To further test our intuitions, we
compared the results from structural controllability with modeling
experiments in simplified resource and pollutant models. We chose these
models because they are easier to parametrise than the qualitative
networks offered by the database, yet they encapsulate well understood
and common dynamics underlying many real world regime shifts. The
pollution system is defined by:

$$
\frac{dx_i}{dt} = u_i-s_ix_i+v_i \frac{x_i^{\alpha_i}}{z_i^{\alpha_i}+x_i^{\alpha_i}}- \sum_{j\not=i}(\delta_{ij}x_i-\delta_{ji}x_j)A_{ij}
$$

where $x_i$ is the level of pollutants of patch $i$ (e.g. a lake), $u_i$
denotes the level of pollutants from human activities, and $s_i$ the
internal loss rate (e.g. sedimentation). The term
$v_i \frac{x_i^{\alpha_i}}{z_i^{\alpha_i}+x_i^{\alpha_i}}$ is a
pollutant release nonlinear function where $v_i$ is the maximum level of
internal pollutants, $\alpha_i$ indicates the sharpness of the function,
and $z_i$ is a threshold level at which the system flips from low to
high nutrient regimes. Connectivity across patches is represented with
the term $\sum_{j\not=i}(\delta_{ij}x_i-\delta_{ji}x_j)A_{ij}$ where
$\delta_{ij}$ is the diffusion coefficient from patch $i \rightarrow j$,
given that $\delta_{ij}$ and $\delta_{ji}$ are not necessarily the same;
while $A_{ij}$ is the adjacency matrix. Similarly, the resource system
is defined by:

$$
\frac{dy_i}{dt} = r_iy_i\left(1-\frac{y_i}{k_i}\right)-c_i \frac{y_i^{\beta_i}}{q_i^{\beta_i}+y_i^{\beta_i}} + \sum_{j\not=i}(\delta_{ij}y_j- \delta_{ji}y_i)A_{ij}
$$

where $y_i$ is the state of the population $i$, $r_i$ is the intrinsic
growth rate, and $k_i$ its carrying capacity. The term
$c_i \frac{y_i^{\beta_i}}{q_i^{\beta_i}+y_i^{\beta_i}}$ is a Holling
type III predation function where $c_i$ represent refuges from predators
in patch $i$, $q_i$ is the half saturation biomass for predators (e.g. a
threshold for high to low abundance), and $\beta_i$ is the curvature
parameter that defines the abruptness of the shift [@Holling:2012fq].
The last term indicates mobility of the resource between patches at a
diffusion rate $\delta_{ij} \neq \delta_{ji}$, and an adjacency matrix
$A_{ij}$ that takes 1 if patches $i$ and $j$ are connected, or zero
otherwise. For both systems the diffusion coefficient ($\delta_{i,j}$)
is normalized by the out degree, or the number of outgoing connections
from each system. This is to ensure that the amount of pollutants or
resources flowing from one system to another never exceeds the amount
available at run time.

Here we concentrate our efforts in exploring numerical simulations of
medium size interconnected systems ($N < 10^2$), with potentially
multiple feedbacks. Analytical solutions for the low dimensional
diffusion problem of our pollution and resource systems can be found in
[@crepin2021]. For each of the dynamical systems (pollution, resource)
we generated networks varying its size ($N:\{25, 50, 75, 100\}$); the
network generative process which could be random (Erdös-Rényi model),
preferential attachment (Barabási-Albert model), or small-world
(Watts-Strogatz model); the network density
($d:\{0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5\}$); and the coupling strength
($\delta_{i,j}:\{low = 0.01:0.05, high = 0.25:0.5\}$). Thus, we have 96
different experimental conditions for which we generated 100 replicates
resulting in 9600 simulation experiments for each dynamical system. Each
model was run for 200 time steps and integration steps of 0.001 $dt$.

For each experiment we identified the feedback vertex set and the
minimum controlling set of the network. Then we manipulated the driver
at run time to decrease nutrients in the pollution system ($u$ decreased
from 5 to -5 allowing for management that can extract nutrients from the
system), or decrease harvest in the resource system ($c$ decreased from
10 to 0) on the controlling set only. We then assess if management of
the control set successfully recovers the networked systems, the
proportion of nodes recovered, or time to recovery when comparing strong
versus weak coupling ($\delta$). The computer code used for our
simulations as well as the curated networks from the regime shifts
database are available at: <https://github.com/juanrocha/imperio>

# Results

Individual regime shifts cannot be controlled or managed by only
targeting variables that have been coded as drivers in the regime shifts
database. Drivers there are defined as variables outside feedbacks that
influence the dynamics of the system, but that are not in turn
influenced by the system itself [@Biggs:2018hx]; which inherits the
logic first proposed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [@MEA2005].
As recent advances in network controllability show [@Liu:2015wl;
@Zanudo:2017hw], to steer the system towards a desired state, an ideal
manager needs to intervene not only on drivers but also on some of the
variables involved in feedback dynamics. In all the individual regime
shifts analyzed, an ideal manager needs to account for the minimum
control set of the DAG and the feedback vertex set (Fig \ref{fig:ind}).
By number of driving nodes, regime shifts such as forest to savanna or
sea grass transitions require higher efforts; but by proportion of
nodes: thermokarst lakes, primary productivity in the Arctic ocean,
tundra to forest, or marine food webs are among the regime shifts where
\>60% of nodes need some intervention. The top controlling variables
are, as expected, related to climate change, biodiversity loss, or food
production (Fig \ref{fig:ind}C). We observe that trophic groups such as
zooplankton, meso predators, or top predators are often part of the
feedback vertex set, while fertilizers use, sewage or soil erosion are
always part of the minimum control set of the DAG.

Coupled regime shifts are harder to manage because the ideal manager
needs to influence more variables. However, the number and proportion of
nodes to be controlled varies depending on the coupling (Fig
\ref{fig:coup}). On average, coupled regime shifts are harder to manage
than individual counterparts (Fig \ref{fig:coup}). For example,
preventing the West Antarctica Ice Sheet collapse (WAIS) implies being
able to intervene on a minimum of 40% of the variables describing
processes underlying the regime shift. But when combined with other
regime shifts, the percentage increases to 49% on average, and a maximum
of 64%. Similarly, managing marine food webs regime shifts requires
intervening on \~66% of the variables describing the individual shift;
but when coupled it varies from as low as 53% with kelp transitions to
as high as 72% with Arctic benthos borealization. This is because
sharing common variables on the minimum driving set reduces the
proportion of nodes to control, while new feedbacks formed when coupling
the network, increase the feedback vertex set. The most common variables
to manage coupled regime shifts are fertiliser use, sewage, fishing and
soil erosion. Climate related variables are important but down the rank
in the list, such as droughts, temperature, and precipitation. Many
variables that have not been previously reported in similar studies
about key drivers of regime shifts are reported here because they are
part of the feedback vertex set, such as management of apex predators,
zooplankton, or fish populations. This however aligns with management
strategies that attempt to manipulate feedback strength to recover
ecosystems from regime shifts, for example fish population manipulations
to recover from eutrophication [@smith2009eutrophication].

\begin{figure}[ht]

Boxplots and scaterplots summarize N = 9600 networks (100 replicates * 96 experimental settings).}
\label{fig:pollution}
\end{figure}

These results suggest that network structure can have implications for
management. If two regime shifts are solely coupled by sharing drivers,
then controlling the common drivers will help the ideal manager to
tackle both regime shift problems. But if the coupling of regime shifts
generates new feedbacks, the minimum number of processes that need to be
controlled increases, making it more difficult to manage the coupled
system than the independent ones. To test that intuition, we developed
simple toy models of resource and pollutant systems where we varied
network structure. The models were not as complex as the causal graphs
previously studied, but they still capture the essential dynamics. Both
typeS of systems in isolation can be controlled by one parameter, the
addition or removal of pollutants $u_i$, and the availability of refuges
from predators $c_i$ respectively. Thus when coupled, any gains or
losses on the ability to manage the regime shifts is due to network
structure alone (the coupling matrix $A_{i,j}$).

\begin{figure}[ht]

\includegraphics[width = 3in, height = 4.5in]{fig4-resource_results}
\caption{\textbf{Resource system simulations} The proportion of nodes recovered by network density for different types of network architecture and coupling strength (A).

\label{fig:resource}
\end{figure}

In the pollution system, the higher the network density the higher the
proportion of nodes recovered in our simulations (Fig
\ref{fig:pollution}A). This effect is accentuated when the coupling
strength $\delta$ is high. However, the proportion of nodes recovered
that belong to the control set is higher when coupling strength is low
(Fig \ref{fig:pollution}B) for all network types tested. This means that
coupling strength increases the probability that a larger proportion of
the system is recovered by managerial actions on the control set, but
the control set in turn becomes vulnerable through incoming connections
that impede complete recovery. We also observe that mean recovery time
is on average faster with high coupling strength, but in networks whose
generative process is preferential attachment (scale-free like degree
distributions) and strong presence of dyadic acyclic graphs (DAG),
recovery can sometimes be slower under high coupling (Fig
\ref{fig:pollution}C). Regardless of network architecture, the lower
bound for proportion of node recovery is as low as 60% for preferential
attachment networks, around 30% for random and small-world networks
under high coupling strength, and almost none for low coupling.

We find contrasting results for the resource simulations. First, the
proportion of nodes recovered declines on average with increasing
network density, although for the case of preferential attachment, all
nodes were recovered regardless of network density in the low coupling
strength scenario (Fig \ref{fig:resource}A). Second, the proportion of
nodes recovered that belong to the control set increases with network
density for the cases of random and small-world networks, but there are
no differences between the high and low coupling strength (Fig
\ref{fig:resource}B). In the case of preferential attachment, the
proportion of recovered nodes that belong to the control set is higher
in networks under the low coupling strength. High coupling strength
reduces the chances of recovery for the control set. While most
simulated systems under low coupling strength recovered by time step
\~130, recovery time varied much more in networks with high coupling
strength (Fig \ref{fig:resource}C).

# Discussion

Our simulation results confirm that network structure matters when
trying to manage coupled regime shifts. The type of network architecture
(random, preferential attachment, small-world) changes the likelihood of
recovering the full system, as well as the coupling strength between
systems. Surprisingly, even under the same network configurations
(N=9600) the type of dynamics occurring in the networks (pollutant
versus resource equations) substantially influenced the qualitative
patterns identified for the full ensemble (Figs \ref{fig:pollution},
\ref{fig:resource}).

In many of our experimental settings the system only recovered partially
despite having full information of the control set at the start of the
simulation. One plausible explanation is that the system required longer
time to recover. A more likely explanation however is that our network
setting allowed for changes in the amount and direction of flow of
nutrients and pollutants. In both systems the diffusion term depended on
the difference in concentration between patches
($\sum_{j\not=i}(\delta_{ij}y_j-\delta_{ji}y_i)A_{i,j}$). While the
adjacency matrix $A_{i,j}$ and the diffusion coefficients $\delta{i,j}$
were constant through the simulation, the direction of flow could change
if the difference $\delta_{ij}y_j-\delta_{ji}y_i$ was positive or
negative. In practice, this means that the feedback structure and thus
the control set can change over time. Another plausible explanation is
that the adjacency matrix ($A_{ij}$) is non-normal. Networks are
non-normal if $AA^T \ne A^TA$, which is the case in our directed graphs,
although matrix asymmetry is not sufficient for strong non-normality
[@asllani2018]. Strong non-normality emerges when the network is
directed (asymmetrical), has low reciprocity, lacks feedback, and has
hierarchical organization [@asllani2018]. While our networks have
feedbacks, we cannot discard the possibility that the lack of recovery
is due to non-normal induced features on the dynamics. The non-normality
of networks increases their return time to equilibrium, thus reducing
their resilience [@asllani2018a].

Knowing the control set at one moment in time is insufficient to gain
full control, and thus recovery, of the connected system. Deriving the
control set at the beginning of the simulation resulted in insufficient
efforts to successfully stir the system towards full recovery (Figs
\ref{fig:pollution}, \ref{fig:resource}). In practice, this is likely to
be the case if one is managing a meta-population where organisms are
free to move from patch to another and likely to go to places where they
find better resources, which change over time. It is less likely to
occur in settings where the flow of resources or pollutants is bounded
by a physical parameter. For example, water between lakes flows
according to gravity, so nutrients are unlikely to be transported
against it. While our assumption can be unrealistic for certain cases,
it opens the case when the control set changes over time. In most real
settings we do not even know the real empirical structure of the network
--how regime shifts are connected [@Rocha:2018gn]. Our results suggest
that even if we knew the structure at a certain point in time,
successfully steering the networked system requires monitoring programs
that enable learning the structure, direction and coupling strength of
the system in real time.

This dynamical feature is unlikely to affect our structural
controllability results derived from causal networks (Fig
\ref{fig:coup}), because the direction of causality is unlikely to
change. However, in a dynamical setting the feedback strength or the
coupling of different variables could change, akin to $\delta{i,j}$ in
our simulations. Thus to apply efficient managerial practices that avoid
tipping cascades, one could gain further insights on the priority of
variables for management, or sequence of actions required. Our results
showed that while climate is important, other coupling mechanisms can be
more relevant in the sense that they appear more in pair-wise
combinations (Fig \ref{fig:coup}). Our results also confirm that dealing
with climate related variables alone won't be enough to prevent tipping
cascades [@Rocha:2018gn], after all, these variables are a small share
of the control set.

Our modelling framework opens potential avenues for future research.
Thus far our assumption is that an ideal manager can intervene in all
subsystems of the controlling set simultaneously. Relaxing thus
assumption would question whether it is possible to recover the system
with asynchronous control. We have not yet considered the cost of
interventions in the system, nor time bounds. With limited budget or
time to achieve the controllability goals, what would be an optimal
strategy? or a sequence of strategies? Another interesting avenue for
future research is a case with multiple managers who have to coordinate
to avoid the tipping cascade, adding a game theoretic layer to the
problem. We believe that relaxing any of our simplifying assumptions to
make the problem more realistic would inevitably make it harder to
control.

Our results show that interconnected systems put certain subsystems and
their managers in a privileged position to steer the system, for good
and bad. Given these power asymmetries, is coordination and cooperation
likely to emerge to avoid tipping cascades? The question is imperative
since both the climate and biodiversity crises underlie a similar
networked structure to the framework here proposed, where a few actors
have disproportional agency to influence the overall dynamics of the
system. Moreover, our results show that when systems are interconnected,
there is no guarantee that one can recover the full system. This implies
that current climate narratives that rely on the potential recovery from
overshoot scenarios [@ritchie2021] should be taken with skepticism,
because the probability of recovery seen in simple one-dimensional
models does not necessarily hold in higher dimensions. Here we show that
the ability to control is reduced. In fact, if one is to believe that
tipping points can be interconnected [@Lenton:2019fv; @Rocha:2018gn;
@Wunderling:fj], each connections becomes a co-dimension (a driver) of
other tipping points, so the problem is never one-dimensional.

# Conclusion

By applying principles of structural controllability, we show here that
connected regime shifts are more difficult to manage and recover than
independent systems. Sharing common drivers can perhaps simplify the
problem, but the emergence of feedbacks increases the number of
variables that need interventions. Interconnected systems come with
additional dynamic challenges for network control and management: being
able to observe and measure how the control set changes over time. In
more realistic settings, the network structure imposes additional
challenges for the emergence of cooperation, power asymmetries, the
cost, timing, and sequence of managerial actions. These questions remain
open areas of research. Yet, tackling the climate or biodiversity crises
requires learning such networks from empirical data. Our theoretical
exercise shows that management practices that can work on one
dimensional systems such as overshooting scenarios for climate may not
necessarily succeed in high dimensional systems. We appeal for the
precautionary principle when dealing with interconnected crises.
