# Introduction

Regime shifts are large, abrupt and persistent changes in the function
and structure of systems \[\@Anonymous:2004bq; \@Scheffer:2001p2968\].
They have been documented in a variety of social-ecological systems
\[\@Scheffer:2009wl; \@Biggs:2018hx\], as well as climate
\[\@Lenton:2019fv\], finance\[\@Guttal:2016kl\], or health
\[\@vandeLeemput:2014eb\], to name a few examples. Changes in structure
and function of ecosystems can diminish the benefits people get from
nature such as food production, employment opportunities, climate
regulation, or water purification \[\@Carpenter:2009jr\]. For example,
the North Atlantic cod collapse represented X M of economic loss and
compromised XX jobs. The weakening or late arrival of the Indian summer
monsoon can compromise food production in one of the most densely
populates regions of the world. How management strategies avoid regime
shifts or recover natural ecosystems to desirable regimes are key
research questions and an active area of research \[\].

Regime shifts can be interconnected \[\@Rocha:2018gn\]. The occurrence
of one can impact the likelihood of another through sequential tipping,
like a domino effect \[\@Wunderling:fj; \@Rocha:2018gn\]; or through
two-way interactions where new feedbacks can amplify or dampen the
probability of tipping over \[\@Rocha:2018gn\]. Conceptual work have
look at these connections in the context of committed risk
\[\@Steffen:2018ku; \@Lenton:2019fv\], and recent modeling work has look
at interactions between climate tipping elements to understand
additional challenges of prediction \[\@Dekker:2010p5900\], or the role
of minimal network configurations \[\@Wunderling:2020jk\]. Besides
climate, cascading effects have also been studied in the context of
engineered systems \[\@Brummitt:2012it; \@DSouza:2017hz\], social and
economic systems \[\@Lee:2011p6824, \@Brummitt:2017cg;
\@Anonymous:2015jy\], or diseases \[\@Watts:2005bq\].

The possibility of cascading regime shifts rises a few additional
challenges for management. First, long distance coupling or
teleconnections \[\@Liu:2015go\] between regime shifts implies that
optimal local or regional managerial practices might not be enough to
reach managerial objectives \[\@Rocha:2018gn; \@Anonymous:2015du\]. This
not only rises the governance issue of with whom does one need to
coordinate for successful management of local resources; it also implies
a tragedy of the commons with potential power asymmetries. Classical
examples include transnational resource systems where pollution or
exploitation of a resource in one side of the border impacts its quality
on the other side, or downstream (e.g. see Young for rivers, Keys for
moisture recycling). Second, and most importantly, connected regime
shifts rises the challenge of identifying sufficient and appropriate
points of intervention for managerial actions. On an interconnected
world, how can we identify leverage points to manage regime shifts? Are
there regime shifts -- or their interactions - that are harder to
manage?

Here we answer these questions in the light of controllability of
complex systems. A system is controllable if one can drive it from any
initial state to any desired final state in finite time
\[\@Kalman:1963bt; \@Liu:2015wl; \@Liu:2011p6911\]. Hence,
controllability quantifies our ability to steer dynamical systems
\[\@Liu:2011p6911\]. While control theory has been fairly well developed
in the realm of linear systems, many open problems remain in the
nonlinear one \[\@Cowan:2012fk; \@Liu:2015wl\]. Strict global
controllability for nonlinear systems has been elusive, but weaker
notions of controllability can be described \[\@Liu:2015wl;
\@Zanudo:2017hw; \@Mochizuki:2013uz\]. For example, open loop control
has been used to steer chaotic systems to desired trajectories in the
phase space. Here we focus on feedback vertex sets as a proxy of
structural controllability \[\@Liu:2015wl; \@Zanudo:2017hw\] of regime
shifts and their interactions. We use network topology to gain insights
on the controllability of regime shift and the management challenges of
their cascading effects. We further test our intuitions with minimal
models of interconnected resources and pollution systems.

# Methods

We study structural controllability first on a static setting, and then
on minimal simulation experiments to approximate the dynamics of
interconnected systems. For the static setting we used causal diagrams
derived from the regime shifts database, an open online repository of
regime shift reviews \[\@Biggs:2018hx\]. The database offers causal
graphs that summarize scientific hypotheses of how regime shifts work.
Each directed graph (N=30) can be interpreted as a network where a link
between two variables exist if a scientific paper has suggested a causal
link in the occurrence of the regime shift \[\@Biggs:2018hx\]. We use
these networks to study structural controllability.

**Feedback control:** To steer a nonlinear system to a desired
attractor, one needs to find the feedback vertex set of the system. When
the system is described as a network, its state variables are
represented by nodes (or vertices), and the dependence between variables
as directed links (or arcs). A feedback in this context is a collection
of nodes and links that form a circular pathway. Feedbacks are often
responsible for the nonlinear dynamics of the system. If a network has
feedbacks, it is called a directed cyclic graph (DCG), and if it lacks
them a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The feedback vertex set is the set
of nodes that if deleted would render a DAG. The feedback arc set is the
set of links that if eliminated would render a DAG. Finding the feedback
vertex set or the arc set are equivalent problems \[\@Zhou:2016hu\], yet
finding the minimum set is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard
(NP-hard) problem. Once the system is reduced to a DAG, linear control
methods can be applied, such as finding unmatched nodes or the Kalman
rank condition for linear systems \[\@Liu:2015wl; \@Liu:2011p6911\].
Hence, the set of nodes that need to be controlled to gain leverage on
the behaviour of a nonlinear system are the feedback vertex set plus the
unmatched nodes of the remaining linear system \[\@Zanudo:2017hw\].

**Structural control on causal networks** We compute the proportion of
nodes that needs to be controlled for all causal networks from the
regime shifts database, as well as their pair-wise combinations. The
pair-wise combinations have been used to study plausible mechanisms that
can couple different types of regime shifts known as cascading effects
\[\@Rocha:2018gn\]. We then compare how structural controllability
change if ecological regime shifts are interconnected.

**Dynamic control on minimal models** To further test our intuitions, we
compared the results from structural controllability with modeling
experiments in simplified resource and pollutant models. We chose these
models because they are easier to parametrise that the qualitative
networks offered by the database, yet they encapsulate well understood
and common dynamics underlying many real world regime shifts. The
pollution system is defined by:

$$
\frac{dx_i}{dt} = u_i-s_ix_i+v_i \frac{x_i^{\alpha_i}}{z_i^{\alpha_i}+x_i^{\alpha_i}}- \sum_{j\not=i}(\delta_{ij}x_i-\delta_{ji}x_j)A_{ij}
$$

where $x_i$ is the level of pollutants of patch $i$ (e.g. a lake), $u_i$
denotes the level of pollutants from human activities, and $s_i$ the
internal loss rate (e.g. sedimentation). The term
$v_i \frac{x_i^{\alpha_i}}{z_i^{\alpha_i}+x_i^{\alpha_i}}$ is a
pollutant release nonlinear function where $v_i$ is the maximum level of
internal pollutants, $\alpha_i$ indicates the sharpness of the function,
and $z_i$ is a threshold level at which the system flips from low to
high nutrient regimes. Connectivity across patches is represented with
the term $\sum_{j\not=i}(\delta_{ij}x_i-\delta_{ji}x_j)A_{ij}$ where
$\delta_{ij}$ is the diffusion coefficient from patch $i \rightarrow j$,
given that $\delta_{ij}$ and $\delta_{ji}$ are not necessarily the same;
while $A_{ij}$ is the adjacency matrix. Similarly, the resource system
is defined by:

$$
\frac{dy_i}{dt} = r_iy_i\left(1-\frac{y_i}{k_i}\right)-c_i \frac{y_i^{\beta_i}}{q_i^{\beta_i}+y_i^{\beta_i}} + \sum_{j\not=i}(d_{ij}y_j-d_{ji}y_i)A_{ij}
$$

where $y_i$ is the state of the population $i$, $r_i$ is the intrinsic
growth rate, and $k_i$ its carrying capacity. The term
$c_i \frac{y_i^{\beta_i}}{q_i^{\beta_i}+y_i^{\beta_i}}$ is a Holling
type III predation function where $c_i$ represent refuges from predators
in patch $i$, $q_i$ is the half saturation biomass for predators (e.g. a
threshold for high to low abundance), and $\beta_i$ is the curvature
parameter that defines the abruptness of the shift \[\@Holling:2012fq\].
The last term indicates mobility of the resource between patches at a
diffusion rate $d_{ij} \neq d_{ji}$, and an adjacency matrix $A_{ij}$
that takes 1 if patches $i$ and $j$ are connected, or zero otherwise.

Here we concentrate our efforts in exploring numerical simulations on
medium size interconnected systems ($N < 10^2$), with potentially
multiple feedbacks. Analytical solutions for the low dimensional
diffusion problem of our pollution and resource systems can be found in
\[Crépin 2021\]. The computer code used for our simulations as well as
the curated networks from the regime shifts database are available at:

# Results

Individual regime shifts cannot be controlled or managed by only
targeting variables that have been coded as drivers in the regime shifts
database. Drivers there are defined as variables outside feedbacks that
influence the dynamics of the system, but that are not in turn
influenced by the system itself \[\@Biggs:2018hx\]; which inherits the
logic first proposed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment \[\@MEA\].
As recent advances in network controllability show \[\@Liu:2015wl;
\@Zanudo:2017hw\], to steer the system towards a desired state an ideal
manager needs to intervene not only drivers but also some of the
variables involved in feedback dynamics. In all the individual regime
shifts analyzed, an ideal manager need to account for the minimum
control set of the DAG and the feedback vertex set (Fig \ref{fig:ind}).
By number of driving nodes, regime shifts such as forest to savanna or
sea grass transitions require higher efforts; but by proportion of
nodes: thermokarst lakes, primary productivity in the Arctic ocean,
tundra to forest, or marine food webs are among the regime shifts where
\>60% of nodes need some intervention. The top controlling variables
are, as expected, related to climate change, biodiversity loss, or food
production (Fig \ref{fig:ind}C). We observe that trophic groups such as
zooplankton, meso predators, or top predators are often part of the
feedback vertex set, while fertilizers use, sewage or soil erosion are
always part of the minimum control set of the DAG.

\label{fig:ind}
\end{figure*}
```
Coupled regime shifts are harder to manage because the ideal manager
needs to intervene more variables. However, the number and proportion of
nodes to be controlled varies depending of the coupling (Fig
\ref{fig:coup}). On average, coupled regime shifts are harder to manage
that individual counterparts (Fig \ref{fig:coup}). For example,
preventing the West Antarctica Ice Sheet collapse (WAIS) implies being
able to intervene a minimum of 40% of the variables describing processes
underlying the regime shift. But when combined with other regime shifts,
the percentage goes up 49% on average, and a maximum of 64%. Similarly,
managing marine foodwebs regime shifts require being able to intervene
\~66% of the variables describing the individual shift; but when coupled
it varies from as low as 53% with kelp transitions to as high as 72%
with Arctic benthos borealisation. This is because sharing common
variables on the minimum driving set reduces the proportion of nodes to
control, while new feedbacks formed when coupling the network increases
the feedback vertex set. The most common variables to manage coupled
regime shifts are fertilisers use, sewage, fishing and soil erosion.
Climate related variables are important but down the rank list, such as
droughts, temperature, and precipitation. Many variables that have not
been previously reported in similar studies about key drivers of regime
shifts are reported here because they are part of the feedback vertex
set, such as management of apex predators, zooplankton, or fish
populations.

\begin{figure*}[ht]

\label{fig:coup}
\end{figure*}
```
These results suggests that network structure can have implications for
management. If two regime shifts are solely coupled by sharing drivers,
then controlling the common drivers will help the ideal manager to
tackle both regime shift problems. But if the coupling of regime shifts
gives rise to new feedbacks, the minimum number of processes that need
to be controlled increases, making more difficult to manage the coupled
system than the independent ones. To test that intuition we developed
simple toy models of resource and pollutant systems where we varied
network structure. The models are not as complex as the causal graphs
previously studied, but they still capture the essential dynamics. Both
type of systems in isolation can be controlled by one parameter, the
addition or removal of pollutants $u_i$, and the availability of refuges
from predators $c_i$ respectively. Thus when coupled, any gains or
losses on the ability to manage the regime shifts is due to network
structure alone (the coupling matrix $A_{i,j}$).
