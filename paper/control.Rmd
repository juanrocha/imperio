abstract: "Abrupt transitions in ecosystems can be interconnected, raising challenges for science and management in identifying sufficient interventions to prevent them or recover from undesirable shifts. Here we use principles of network controllability to explore how difficult it is to manage coupled regime shifts. We find that coupled regime shifts are easier to manage when they share drivers, but can become harder to manage if new feedbacks are formed when coupled. Simulation experiments showed that both network structure and coupling strength matter in our ability to manage interconnected systems. This theoretical observations calls for an empirical assessment of cascading regime shifts in ecosystems and warns about our limited ability to control cascading effects."

# Introduction

Regime shifts are large, abrupt and persistent changes in the function
and structure of systems [@Anonymous:2004bq; @Scheffer:2001p2968].
They have been documented in a variety of social-ecological systems
[@Scheffer:2009wl; @Biggs:2018hx], as well as climate
[@Lenton:2019fv], finance[@Guttal:2016kl], or health
[@vandeLeemput:2014eb], to name a few examples. Changes in structure
and function of ecosystems can diminish the benefits people get from
nature such as food production, employment opportunities, climate
regulation, or water purification [@Carpenter:2009jr]. For example,
the North Atlantic cod collapse represented millions of economic loss and
compromised more than 35000 jobs in 400 coastal communities[@gien2000land].
The weakening or late arrival of the Indian summer
monsoon can compromise food production in one of the most densely
populates regions of the world. How management strategies avoid regime
shifts or recover natural ecosystems to desirable regimes are key
research questions and an active area of research.

But one theoretical fact that complicates their study and management is
that regime shifts can be interconnected [@Rocha:2018gn]. The occurrence
of one can impact the likelihood of another through sequential tipping,
like a domino effect [@Wunderling:fj; @Rocha:2018gn]; or through
two-way interactions where new feedbacks can amplify or dampen the
probability of tipping over [@Rocha:2018gn]. Conceptual work have
look at these connections in the context of committed risk
[@Steffen:2018ku; @Lenton:2019fv], and recent modeling work has look
at interactions between climate tipping elements to understand
additional challenges of prediction [@Dekker:2010p5900], or the role
of minimal network configurations [@Wunderling:2020jk]. Besides
climate, cascading effects have also been studied in the context of
engineered systems [@Brummitt:2012it; @DSouza:2017hz], social and
economic systems [@Lee:2011p6824, @Brummitt:2017cg;
@Anonymous:2015jy], or diseases [@Watts:2005bq].

The possibility of cascading regime shifts rises a few additional
challenges for management. First, long distance coupling or
teleconnections [@Liu:2015go] between regime shifts implies that
optimal local or regional managerial practices might not be enough to
reach managerial objectives [@Rocha:2018gn; @Anonymous:2015du]. This
not only rises the governance issue of with whom does one need to
coordinate for successful management of local resources; it also implies
a tragedy of the commons with potential power asymmetries. Classical
examples include transnational resource systems where pollution or
exploitation of a resource in one side of the border impacts its quality
on the other side, or downstream [@young2002institutional; @keys2018megacity].
Second, and most importantly, connected regime
shifts rises the challenge of identifying sufficient and appropriate
points of intervention for managerial actions. In an interconnected
world, how can we identify leverage points to manage regime shifts? Are
there regime shifts -- or their interactions - that are harder to
manage?

\end{figure*}
```

Here we answer these questions in the light of controllability of
complex systems. A system is controllable if one can drive it from any
initial state to any desired final state in finite time
[@Kalman:1963bt; @Liu:2015wl; @Liu:2011p6911]. Hence,
controllability quantifies our ability to steer dynamical systems
[@Liu:2011p6911]. While control theory has been fairly well developed
in the realm of linear systems, many open problems remain in the
nonlinear one [@Cowan:2012fk; @Liu:2015wl]. Strict global
controllability for nonlinear systems has been elusive, but weaker
notions of controllability can be described [@Liu:2015wl;
@Zanudo:2017hw; @Mochizuki:2013uz]. For example, open loop control
has been used to steer chaotic systems to desired trajectories in the
phase space. Here we focus on feedback vertex sets as a proxy of
structural controllability [@Liu:2015wl; @Zanudo:2017hw] of regime
shifts and their interactions. We use network topology to gain insights
on the controllability of regime shift and the management challenges of
their cascading effects. We further test our intuitions with minimal
models of interconnected resources and pollution systems.

# Methods

We study structural controllability first on a static setting, and then
on minimal simulation experiments to approximate the dynamics of
interconnected systems. For the static setting we used causal diagrams
derived from the regime shifts database, an open online repository of
regime shift reviews [@Biggs:2018hx]. The database offers causal
graphs that summarize scientific hypotheses of how regime shifts work.
Each directed graph (N=30) can be interpreted as a network where a link
between two variables exist if a scientific paper has suggested a causal
link in the occurrence of the regime shift [@Biggs:2018hx]. We use
these networks to study structural controllability.

**Feedback control:** To steer a nonlinear system to a desired
attractor, one needs to find the feedback vertex set of the system. When
the system is described as a network, its state variables are
represented by nodes (or vertices), and the dependence between variables
as directed links (or arcs). A feedback in this context is a collection
of nodes and links that form a circular pathway. Feedbacks are often
responsible for the nonlinear dynamics of the system. If a network has
feedbacks, it is called a directed cyclic graph (DCG), and if it lacks
them a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The feedback vertex set is the set
of nodes that if deleted would render a DAG. The feedback arc set is the
set of links that if eliminated would render a DAG. Finding the feedback
vertex set or the arc set are equivalent problems [@Zhou:2016hu], yet
finding the minimum set is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard
(NP-hard) problem. Once the system is reduced to a DAG, linear control
methods can be applied, such as finding unmatched nodes or the Kalman
rank condition for linear systems [@Liu:2015wl; @Liu:2011p6911].
Hence, the set of nodes that need to be controlled to gain leverage on
the behaviour of a nonlinear system are the feedback vertex set plus the
unmatched nodes of the remaining linear system [@Zanudo:2017hw].

**Structural control on causal networks** We compute the proportion of
nodes that needs to be controlled for all causal networks from the
regime shifts database, as well as their pair-wise combinations. The
pair-wise combinations have been used to study plausible mechanisms that
can couple different types of regime shifts known as cascading effects
[@Rocha:2018gn]. We then compare how structural controllability
change if ecological regime shifts are interconnected.

Top controlling nodes are ranked by the number of pair-wise compbinations where they appear on the control set (D). For a sample of 30 regime shifts, there are 900 pair-wise combinations or 870 combinations of non-identical regime shifts. Thus, for example, fertilizers use and sewage appear in more than 175 of these combinations.}
\label{fig:coup}
\end{figure*}
```


**Dynamic control on minimal models** To further test our intuitions, we
compared the results from structural controllability with modeling
experiments in simplified resource and pollutant models. We chose these
models because they are easier to parametrise that the qualitative
networks offered by the database, yet they encapsulate well understood
and common dynamics underlying many real world regime shifts. The
pollution system is defined by:


$$
\frac{dx_i}{dt} = u_i-s_ix_i+v_i \frac{x_i^{\alpha_i}}{z_i^{\alpha_i}+x_i^{\alpha_i}}- \sum_{j\not=i}(\delta_{ij}x_i-\delta_{ji}x_j)A_{ij}
$$

where $x_i$ is the level of pollutants of patch $i$ (e.g. a lake), $u_i$
denotes the level of pollutants from human activities, and $s_i$ the
internal loss rate (e.g. sedimentation). The term
$v_i \frac{x_i^{\alpha_i}}{z_i^{\alpha_i}+x_i^{\alpha_i}}$ is a
pollutant release nonlinear function where $v_i$ is the maximum level of
internal pollutants, $\alpha_i$ indicates the sharpness of the function,
and $z_i$ is a threshold level at which the system flips from low to
high nutrient regimes. Connectivity across patches is represented with
the term $\sum_{j\not=i}(\delta_{ij}x_i-\delta_{ji}x_j)A_{ij}$ where
$\delta_{ij}$ is the diffusion coefficient from patch $i \rightarrow j$,
given that $\delta_{ij}$ and $\delta_{ji}$ are not necessarily the same;
while $A_{ij}$ is the adjacency matrix. Similarly, the resource system
is defined by:

$$
\frac{dy_i}{dt} = r_iy_i\left(1-\frac{y_i}{k_i}\right)-c_i \frac{y_i^{\beta_i}}{q_i^{\beta_i}+y_i^{\beta_i}} + \sum_{j\not=i}(d_{ij}y_j-d_{ji}y_i)A_{ij}
$$

where $y_i$ is the state of the population $i$, $r_i$ is the intrinsic
growth rate, and $k_i$ its carrying capacity. The term
$c_i \frac{y_i^{\beta_i}}{q_i^{\beta_i}+y_i^{\beta_i}}$ is a Holling
type III predation function where $c_i$ represent refuges from predators
in patch $i$, $q_i$ is the half saturation biomass for predators (e.g. a
threshold for high to low abundance), and $\beta_i$ is the curvature
parameter that defines the abruptness of the shift [@Holling:2012fq].
The last term indicates mobility of the resource between patches at a
diffusion rate $d_{ij} \neq d_{ji}$, and an adjacency matrix $A_{ij}$
that takes 1 if patches $i$ and $j$ are connected, or zero otherwise.

Here we concentrate our efforts in exploring numerical simulations on
medium size interconnected systems ($N < 10^2$), with potentially
multiple feedbacks. Analytical solutions for the low dimensional
diffusion problem of our pollution and resource systems can be found in
[@crepin2021]. For each of the dynamical systems (pollution, resource) we 
generated networks varying its size ($N:\{25, 50, 75, 100\}$); the network generative
process which could be random (Erd√∂s-R√©nyi model), preferential attachment 
(Barab√°si-Albert model), or small-world (Watts-Strogatz model); the network 
density ($d:\{0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5\}$); and the coupling strength ($\delta_{i,j}:\{low = 0.01:0.05, high = 0.25:0.5\}$). Thus, we have 96 different experimental conditions
for which we generated 100 replicates resulting in 9600 simulation experiments for
each dynamical system. Each model was run for 200 time steps and integration steps
of 0.001 $dt$.

For each experiment we identified the feedback vertex
set and the minimum controlling set of the network. Then we manipulated the
driver at run time to decrease nutrients in the pollution system
($u$ decreased from 5 to -5 allowing for management that can extract nutrients
from the system), or decrease harvest in the resource system ($c$ decreased
from 10 to 0) on the controlling set only. We then assess if management on the
control set successfully recover the networked systems, the proportion of nodes
recovered, or time to recovery when comparing strong versus weak coupling ($\delta$).
The computer code used for our simulations as well as
the curated networks from the regime shifts database are available at:

# Results

Individual regime shifts cannot be controlled or managed by only
targeting variables that have been coded as drivers in the regime shifts
database. Drivers there are defined as variables outside feedbacks that
influence the dynamics of the system, but that are not in turn
influenced by the system itself [@Biggs:2018hx]; which inherits the
logic first proposed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [@MEA2005].
As recent advances in network controllability show [@Liu:2015wl;
@Zanudo:2017hw], to steer the system towards a desired state an ideal
manager needs to intervene not only drivers but also some of the
variables involved in feedback dynamics. In all the individual regime
shifts analyzed, an ideal manager need to account for the minimum
control set of the DAG and the feedback vertex set (Fig \ref{fig:ind}).
By number of driving nodes, regime shifts such as forest to savanna or
sea grass transitions require higher efforts; but by proportion of
nodes: thermokarst lakes, primary productivity in the Arctic ocean,
tundra to forest, or marine food webs are among the regime shifts where
\>60% of nodes need some intervention. The top controlling variables
are, as expected, related to climate change, biodiversity loss, or food
production (Fig \ref{fig:ind}C). We observe that trophic groups such as
zooplankton, meso predators, or top predators are often part of the
feedback vertex set, while fertilizers use, sewage or soil erosion are
always part of the minimum control set of the DAG.

Coupled regime shifts are harder to manage because the ideal manager
needs to intervene more variables. However, the number and proportion of
nodes to be controlled varies depending of the coupling (Fig
\ref{fig:coup}). On average, coupled regime shifts are harder to manage
that individual counterparts (Fig \ref{fig:coup}). For example,
preventing the West Antarctica Ice Sheet collapse (WAIS) implies being
able to intervene a minimum of 40% of the variables describing processes
underlying the regime shift. But when combined with other regime shifts,
the percentage goes up 49% on average, and a maximum of 64%. Similarly,
managing marine foodwebs regime shifts require being able to intervene
\~66% of the variables describing the individual shift; but when coupled
it varies from as low as 53% with kelp transitions to as high as 72%
with Arctic benthos borealisation. This is because sharing common
variables on the minimum driving set reduces the proportion of nodes to
control, while new feedbacks formed when coupling the network increases
the feedback vertex set. The most common variables to manage coupled
regime shifts are fertilisers use, sewage, fishing and soil erosion.
Climate related variables are important but down the rank in the list, such as
droughts, temperature, and precipitation. Many variables that have not
been previously reported in similar studies about key drivers of regime
shifts are reported here because they are part of the feedback vertex
set, such as management of apex predators, zooplankton, or fish
populations. This however aligns with management strategies that attempt
to manipulate feedback strength to recover ecosystems from regime shifts,
for example fish population manipulations to recover from eutrophication
[@smith2009eutrophication].

\label{fig:pollution}
\end{figure}
```


These results suggests that network structure can have implications for
management. If two regime shifts are solely coupled by sharing drivers,
then controlling the common drivers will help the ideal manager to
tackle both regime shift problems. But if the coupling of regime shifts
gives rise to new feedbacks, the minimum number of processes that need
to be controlled increases, making more difficult to manage the coupled
system than the independent ones. To test that intuition we developed
simple toy models of resource and pollutant systems where we varied
network structure. The models are not as complex as the causal graphs
previously studied, but they still capture the essential dynamics. Both
type of systems in isolation can be controlled by one parameter, the
addition or removal of pollutants $u_i$, and the availability of refuges
from predators $c_i$ respectively. Thus when coupled, any gains or
losses on the ability to manage the regime shifts is due to network
structure alone (the coupling matrix $A_{i,j}$).

\label{fig:resource}
\end{figure}
```


In the pollution system, the higher the network density the higher the proportion
of nodes recovered in our simulations (Fig \ref{fig:pollution}A). This effect is accentuated 
when the coupling strength $\delta$ is high. However, the proportion of 
nodes recovered that belong to the control set is higher when coupling
strength is low (Fig \ref{fig:pollution}B) for all network types tested. This
means that coupling strength increases the probability that a larger proportion
of the system is recovered by managerial actions on the control set, but the 
control set in turns becomes vulnerable through incoming connections that
impedes complete recovery. We also observe that mean recovery time is on average
faster with high coupling strength, but in networks whose generative 
process is preferential attachment (scale-free like degree distributions) and 
strong presence of dyadic acyclic graphs (DAG), sometimes recovery can be slower
under high coupling (Fig \ref{fig:pollution}C). Regardless of network 
architecture, the lower bound for proportion of nodes recovery is as low as 60% 
for preferential attachment networks, and around 30% for random and small-world 
networks under high coupling strength, and almost none for low coupling.

We find contrasting results on the resource simulations. First, the proportion 
of nodes recovered declines on average with increasing network density, although
for the case of preferential attachment, all nodes were recovered regardless of
network density on the low coupling strength scenario (Fig \ref{fig:resource}A). 
Second, the proportion of nodes recovered that belong to the control set 
increases with network density for the cases of random and small-world networks,
but there are not differences between the high and low coupling strength 
(Fig \ref{fig:resource}B). In the case of preferential attachment, the 
proportion of recovered nodes that belong to the control set is higher in
networks under the low coupling strength treatment, meaning that one needs 
larger control sets. While most simulated systems under low coupling strength
recovered by time step ~130, recovery time is much more varied in networks with
high coupling streght (Fig \ref{fig:resource}C).

# Discussion

Our simulation results confirm that network structure matters when trying
to manage coupled regime shifts. The type of network architecture (random,
preferential attachment, small-world) changes the likelihood of recovering
the full system, as well as the coupling strength between systems. Surprisingly,
even under the same network configurations (N=9600) the type of dynamics played
in the networks (pollutant versus resource equations) changed substantially
the qualitative patterns identified for the full ensemble (Figs \ref{fig:pollution},
\ref{fig:resource}).

[Check with ASC if I did the correct experiments on resources - or how to interpret it]

In many of our experimental settings the system was only partially recovered 
despite we had full information of the control set at the start of the
simulation. One plausible explanation is that the system required longer time
to recover. Another more likely explanation is that our network setting allowed
for changes in the amount and direction of flow of nutrients and pollutants. 
In both systems the diffusion term depends on the difference in concentration 
between patches ($\sum_{j\not=i}(d_{ij}y_j-d_{ji}y_i)A_{i,j}$). While the 
adjacency matrix $A_{i,j}$ and the diffusion coefficients $\Delta{i,j}$ were 
constant through the simulation, the direction of flow could change if the 
difference $d_{ij}y_j-d_{ji}y_i$ was positive or negative. In practice, this
means that the feedback structure and thus the control set can change over
time, resulting in insufficient efforts to successfully stir the system towards
full recovery.

In practice, this is likely to be the case if one is managing metapopulation
dynamics where animals are free to move from patch to patch and likely will do
to places where they find better resources, which change over time. It is less
likely to occur in settings where the flow of resources or pollutants is bounded
by a physical parameter. For example, water between lakes flows according to 
gravity, so nutrients are unlikely to be transported against it. While our 
assumption is unrealistic for certain cases, it opens the case when the control
set changes over time. In most real settings we do not even know the empirical
structure of the network --how regime shifts are connected. Our results shows
that even if we know the structure at certain point in time, successfully
steering the networked system requires monitoring programs that enables learning
the structure, direction and coupling strength of the system in real time.

This dynamical feature is unlikely to affect our structural controllability
results derived from causal networks, because the direction of causality is 
unlikely to change. However, in a dynamical setting what can change is the 
feedback strength or the coupling of different variables, akin 
to $\Delta{i,j}$ in our simulations. Thus to apply efficient managerial
practices that avoid tipping cascades, one could get further insights on the 
priority of variables for management, or sequence of actions required. Our 
results showed that while climate is important, other coupling mechanism
can be more relevant in the sense that they appear in more pair-wise 
combinations. Our results also confirm that dealing with climate related 
variables alone wont be enough to prevent tipping cascades, after all, these 
variables are a small share of the control set. 

Our modelling framework opens the door for potential avenues of future research.
Thus far our assumption is that an ideal manager can intervene all subsystems
of the controlling set simultaneously. Relaxing such assumption would pose the 
question whether is possible to recover the system with asynchronous control. 
Another interesting avenue of future research is a more realistic case 
with multiple managers who have to coordinate to avoid the tipping cascade. 
Our results shows that interconnected systems posit certain subsystems and their
managers in a privilege position to steer the system, for both good and bad.
Given these power asymmetries, is coordination and cooperation likely to emerge
to avoid tipping cascades? The question is imperative since both the climate
and biodiversity crises underlie a similar networked structure and the framework
here proposed, where a few actors have disproportional agency to influence 
the overall dynamics of the system.
